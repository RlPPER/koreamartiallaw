I created this repository to shed light on a serious situation in South Korea. On December 2, 2024, the President of South Korea declared martial law. (For context, back in the 1980s, a Korean president, Chun Doo-hwan, also imposed martial law, which led to many civilians losing their lives at the hands of the military.)

The people of South Korea and many members of the National Assembly are responding wisely to this situation, but it still requires more attention. 
That’s why I decided to create a free service to accurately inform people overseas about this crisis. Using AI, this service provides real-time summaries of news related to the martial law declaration from South Korea's largest portal site (The most widely used website in South Korea; NAVER) under its news category.
Let South Korea show you that peace and love will always triumph over force. Thank you.
